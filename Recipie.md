# Recipie for Asparagus and Red Pepper Salad
 ## Steps:

1. Take a small pot of water for boiling on the stove. Add 1 tsp of salt to water. 

2. While the water is coming to a boil prepare asparagus for blanching by removing the lower 1/2" of stem and chopping the remaining stalk into three even pieces. Slice the bell pepper into 1/4" slices and cut them in half. Set them aside.

3. Once water is getting boiled, carefully drop in the asparagus. Boil for 5 minutes or until they are a bright green shade.

4. While the asparagus is getting blanched, prepare a bowl with ice water to dunk the asparagus into. Once the 5 minutes are up remove the asparagus by draining it into a colander. Add it to the ice water. Drain the asparagus again and shake to dry.

5. In a large mixing bowl or salad bowl add the spinach, bell pepper, asparagus, and pine nuts. Toss to combine. Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to add the dressing. The salad is ready and can be served.

## Vinaigrette:
1. Add red wine vinegar, salt, mustard, lemon juice, salt and pepper to a small bowl. Using a whisk or a fork, whisk the ingredients together until it is well blended.

2. Slowly pour the olive oil with one hand while constantly whisking the mixture with the other until the entire mixture comes together.

3. Cover and set aside at room temperature until it is ready for serving. If it wil be served after more than a few hours, put dressing in the fridge and bring to room temperature again before serving.
